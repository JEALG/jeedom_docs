[← Main page](../index.md)

Rhasspy-BatchTester is a python script that provide a way to mass test intents.

You can test one or several sentences to intent recognition, or define a json with several sentences, intent that should be detected, and test it in one go with a report of matched / unmatched intents and there slots.

So, once you define new intents and re-train your rhasspy, just run the test to be sure it doesn't break other intents!
