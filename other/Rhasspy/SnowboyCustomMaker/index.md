Snowboy-CustomMaker is a set of python script to help recording custom wakeword samples and generate pmdl file.

## Installation

This tool require python 3 and four python package that you will need to install:

- requests

SSH to your rhasspy device, on /home/pi folder.
Install python packages, download snowboyCustomMaker-list.txt, then download this list into SnowboyCustomMaker folder:


```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-numpy python3-pyaudio python3-soundfile python3-requests
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KiboOst/jeedom_docs/master/other/Rhasspy/SnowboyCustomMaker/snowboyCustomMaker-list.txt
wget -P /home/pi/SnowboyCustomMaker -i snowboyCustomMaker-list.txt
cd SnowboyCustomMaker
```

You now have three python scripts:
- snowboyRecord.py: Used to record your custom wakeword samples as wav files.
- snowboyTrain.py: Used to generate the pmdl file from
- utils.py: Just keep it there, used by the snowbiyRecord script.

You can have a look at these files [here](https://github.com/KiboOst/jeedom_docs/tree/master/other/Rhasspy/SnowboyCustomMaker)

## snowboyRecord

This script is based on [snips-record-personal-hotword](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-record-personal-hotword)
It have been converted to python3, cleaned, and rhasspied!

It will guide you through recording thee wave sample file to later generate your custom wakeword pdml file for Rhasspy (or whatever use snowboy wakeword).

```bash
cd SnowboyCustomMaker
python3 snowboyRecord.py --wakeword myhotword
```
**myhotword** is an identifier for your wakeword. The three sample files with be saved into SnowboyCustomMaker/myhotword folder, and *snowboyTrain* will get them to generate myhotword.pmdl file. You can use heyJarvis_Dady then later record heyJarvis_Mom, etc.
